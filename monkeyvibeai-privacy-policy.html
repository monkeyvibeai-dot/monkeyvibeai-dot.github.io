  <h1>MonkeyVibe AI - Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> December 12, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>MonkeyVibe AI</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and protects

  </p>

  <h2>What this app does</h2>

    <li>Posts Pins to our Pinterest account (for example, daily images or video links).</li>
    <li>Optionally reads basic analytics for our own Pinterest content (impressions, saves, clicks, etc.).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Authorization data:</strong> Pinterest OAuth tokens that allow our tool to post Pins and/or read analytics for our account.</li>
    <li><strong>Content data:</strong> Media (images/links) that we choose to upload and post.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics data (optional):</strong> Aggregated performance metrics for our own Pins and account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate with Pinterest and perform actions we request (posting Pins, retrieving analytics).</li>
    <li>To measure performance of our own content and improve future posts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell personal information. We do not share personal information with third parties except as required
    to operate Pinterest API functionality and as required by law.

  <h2>Data storage and security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Access tokens are stored securely and used only for the purpose described above.</li>
    <li>We take reasonable steps to protect tokens and posted content from unauthorized access.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Retention</h2>

    We keep authorization tokens only as long as necessary to operate the automation, or until access is revoked.
  </p>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
